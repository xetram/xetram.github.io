Ours is a mostly natural home (even wall paint is natural) - built so as to minimize microplastic pollution, carbon footprint. Plus it is equipped with solar panels which more than meet our energy demands.

We're on the second floor (2 flights of stairs), plus there is a [guest room](../l3/) with an attached bath and kitchenette above.

We're vegetarian - so no meat to be cooked or consumed here.

Internet is pretty strong - 200MBps as of 2021.
