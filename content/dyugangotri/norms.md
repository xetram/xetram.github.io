## Intro
Welcome and have a pleasant stay. This page should help you fit right in. Owners occupy L0 and L2 (ground and second floors).

Telegram channels for asynchronous communication (Owner and respective current occupant families only):

- L1 [https://t.me/joinchat/XnMFL_ABLbcyNWUx](https://t.me/joinchat/XnMFL_ABLbcyNWUx)
- L3?


## Occupancy
- Any significant increase in occupancy requires prior approval. Examples: A few guests staying in for multiple weeks, or big group of visitors sleeping over.
- Big events outside your premises (example: parties in the terrace) require prior approval.
- <u>No smoking</u> anywhere in or around the building.
- No Non-Vegetarian food (meat, fish etc..) on premises.
- No illegal activities online or offline which could land me in trouble.
- Segregating dry and wet waste is a must.
- Background cultural norms: Traditional Hindu.
- Please note that there may even be an emergency and we live in the same building. We might need to enter your residence for maintenance purposes even if you're away on a vacation (as specified in the agreement). Hence:
  - Use the main door lock we've provided. It may be electronically operated (see demo link below). You can set a PIN to avoid accidental opening. 
  - If you put your own padlock due to some contingency - be sure to provide us with a pair of keys.

### Workers
- Please oversee any workers you let into the premises throughout their stay. We've seen movers and packers soiling toilets, internet guys prying out socket plates and planning to damage wiring by shorting cables, electricians littering the terrace etc..

## Damage, repair, modifications.

- In case of any structural problem (eg. dampness, big leaks etc..) please inform us ASAP.
- Responsibility/ share of repair will be reasonably assigned on a case-by-case basis.
- Any significant modifications require written permission. Example: Drilling big holes, changing household wiring, wallpapers, painting.


## Terrace and balconeys
- We do rainwater harvesting. So no litter or pollution on the roof.
- No fireworks there - rockets launched from bottles are ok.
- Please don’t put a clothes line facing neighbor Nadaf's balconey - he objects on aesthetic grounds. Drying rack should be fine.
- First floor stair lights are opposite to neighbor Nadaf’s bedroom, and he objects to it being left on after 10PM. So, please take care.

## Walls
- Please ask for prior written permission and guidance if drilling big holes for AC or chimney.
- Don't paint or write on walls with ink. We prefer not to paint walls in our eco-friendly, healthy building. Chalkpiece or other easily erasable material is ok - but should not erode walls.
- Drive nails (if needed) only in grouts between bricks. Use preexisting nails where possible. Also, electric pipe positions can easily be deduced in our mud block walls - so you can avoid them by looking for slight linear color difference.

## Wiring
- UPS points are provided as follows:
  - L0 and L1: below the L0 stairs.
  - L2 and L3: In the terrace.

### Cable and internet
- Most windows and ventilators have mosquito meshes. Please don’t make holes in them - we have made provisions for getting cable and internet connection from suitable points in the terrace. They should be intact when you leave. If you MUST bring in a new wire (with owners' agreement, of course), use the pipe (covered by a dummy white plate) provided near the roof by the stairs in each floor.
- Don't cut cables inside the boards; don't remove sockets. Use the sockets provided.
    - Say you subscribe to Airtel internet service, and they use 2-pair cable. Just buy a short (8 pair) lan patch cable, cut it in two, join the 2-pair cables at each end to the appliance and the cable provider wire.
- If you get a dish antenna, place it in the prescribed spot (consult the owners).
- Your phone/ internet/ TV cables should be properly placed.
    - They should not obstruct carefree movement.
    - They should not increase ugliness.

## Appliances

- Glen 1050 cm/h demo (1st and 2nd floors) and maintenance instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwt-zLlZQiY).
- Cabinet number lock - L1 code - 2016 (Don't change this please.)
- Tinxy wifi lock controller Demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiY89FcC-Eo).
- Controls for exterior plug point are deliberately placed indoor, so that occupants can disable them when they want. This is done to ensure that thieves don’t use them to turn on power tools facilitating break-ins. Such controls are marked with a `^` sign as of this writing.
