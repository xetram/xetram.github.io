<details><summary>Defects and regrets</summary>

- chajja-s - Dissatisified with tile chajja execution. Should have gone with RCC chajja-s in hindsight.
  - Some of the tile chajja-s did not adequately cover the windows! Noticed this months after construction completion. Exposed wood accrued rain damage.
  - L2 front bathroom window shutter top is too close to the steel beam holding up the tiles. Could not even close it in winter.
  - Steel beams used in the tile chajja-s remain unpainted.
- Painter defects
  - l4 FLOOR polishing - black spots
  - l1 floor polishing - bucket placement mark in hall and room
  - Cleaning off putty in 1F deva-gRha remained impossible (painters cited "rough surface").
  - Painters missed certain spots in L3 when applying clear coat paint - back wall and wall above chajja towards the stairs. This led to dampness after rains.

## Planning
- Paperwork: BBMP approval was by Kiran(?). 
- BESCOM contractor (for permanent connection) was nAgarjuna / manju (smooth talking scamster). 
- BWSSB contractor was Govindarajulu (via nAgArjuna).
