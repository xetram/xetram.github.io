## Vision
### Paint avoidence
Idea was to minimize emission of microplastics into the environment by use of synthetic paints (as is the unfortunate practice going against the grain of our revered ancestors who enjoyed the earth without poisoning it with long lasting pollutants). Only partly successful - contractor insisted on transparent clear coat for much of the exterior, वासुकिः insisted on usual paint for his floor, and there was no readily available non-synthetic alternative for painting wood and metal.
