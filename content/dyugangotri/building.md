## Vision
### Minimize carbon footprint / embodied energy
- by using alternative building techniques which avoid baked bricks, reduce steel and concrete use (via alternative roofs like jack-arch and filler slabs).
- Installation of on-grid solar plant on the roof for electricity self sufficiency.
- Rainwater harvesting
 
### Microplastic pollution avoidence
#### Paint
Idea was to minimize emission of microplastics into the environment by use of synthetic paints (as is the unfortunate practice going against the grain of our revered ancestors who enjoyed the earth without poisoning it with long lasting pollutants).

Only partly successful - 

- contractor insisted on transparent clear coat for much of the exterior, 
- वासुकिः insisted on usual paint for his floor,
- there was no readily available non-synthetic alternative for painting wood and metal.
- Even supposedly all natural lime-based paint purchased from Manoj Doot of Vedic paints came in plastic cans.

#### Wood lamination
- Wood laminates are often synthetic polymers. Polishes and varnishes tend to be synthetic as well. We went with Birch Plywood imported from Russia, purchased from Khemka Plywood at good prices. Quite good - doesn't need polish - but better with it. In hindsight, we should have done edge-bending lamination to mitigate bends in doors. Also, in some places, we saw mild mold formation. This was solved with linseed oil polishing.
- Some of the wooden surfaces was polished with Raw linseed oil.

## Execution
- Structural design by shrI pramod of [http://www.mahijaa.com/](http://www.mahijaa.com/), protege of shrI yogAnanda of grAmavidyA.
- Plans
  - sweethome3d [here](http://www.sweethome3d.com/viewHome.jsp?id=2232).

- Execution of building by contractor shrI nAgesh and his son shrI vijay - Dec 2019 to Apr 2021. His team of subcontractors included 
  - Mr prabhu (electrical, represented by zAkir and parashurAm), lingAreddy (plumbing)
  - ravi reddy (painting) - unhappy with supervision and execution.
  - Munna/ munirAju (window/ door carpentry)
  - kumaresh (floor tiles). 
  - vIresha and family were the resident guards.
- We separately engaged shrI santosh for interior cabinets and wardrobes (excellent experience)
- shrI ramAkAnta (musquito screens). 
- BWell - rudraprakAsh.
- Building tips elsewhere.

<details><summary>Defects and regrets</summary>

- chajja-s - Dissatisified with tile chajja execution. Should have gone with RCC chajja-s in hindsight.
  - Some of the tile chajja-s did not adequately cover the windows! Noticed this months after construction completion. Exposed wood accrued rain damage.
  - L2 front bathroom window shutter top is too close to the steel beam holding up the tiles. Could not even close it in winter.
  - Steel beams used in the tile chajja-s remain unpainted.
- Painter defects
  - l4 FLOOR polishing - black spots
  - l1 floor polishing - bucket placement mark in hall and room
  - Cleaning off putty in 1F deva-gRha remained impossible (painters cited "rough surface").
  - Painters missed certain spots in L3 when applying clear coat paint - back wall and wall above chajja towards the stairs. This led to dampness after rains.

### Planning
- Paperwork: BBMP approval was by Kiran(?). 
- BESCOM contractor (for permanent connection) was nAgarjuna / manju (smooth talking scamster). 
- BWSSB contractor was Govindarajulu (via nAgArjuna).

## Solar plant
- Planning and approval - Dec 2021. No contractors used - went in person via official channels.
- Installation - Vinod

### Structure

- Materials
