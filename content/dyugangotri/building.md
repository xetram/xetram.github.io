## Vision
### Microplastic pollution avoidence
#### Paint
Idea was to minimize emission of microplastics into the environment by use of synthetic paints (as is the unfortunate practice going against the grain of our revered ancestors who enjoyed the earth without poisoning it with long lasting pollutants).

Only partly successful - 

- contractor insisted on transparent clear coat for much of the exterior, 
- वासुकिः insisted on usual paint for his floor,
- there was no readily available non-synthetic alternative for painting wood and metal.
- Even supposedly all natural lime-based paint purchased from Manoj Doot of Vedic paints came in plastic cans.

#### Wood lamination
- Wood laminates are often synthetic polymers. Polishes and varnishes tend to be synthetic as well. We went with Birch Plywood imported from Russia, purchased from Khemka Plywood at good prices. Quite good - doesn't need polish - but better with it. In hindsight, we should have done edge-bending lamination to mitigate bends in doors.
- The wood was polished with Raw linseed oil.
