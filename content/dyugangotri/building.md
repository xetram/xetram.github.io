## Execution

- Structural design by shrI pramod of [http://www.mahijaa.com/](http://www.mahijaa.com/), protege of shrI yogAnanda of grAmavidyA.
- Execution by contractor shrI nAgesh and his son shrI vijay. His team of subcontractors included Mr prabhu (electrical, represented by zAkir and parashurAm), lingAreddy (plumbing), ravi reddy (painting), Munna (window/ door carpentry). We separately engaged shrI santosh for interior cabinets and wardrobes (excellent experience). vIresha and family were the resident guards. Well - rudraprakAsh.
- Paperwork: BBMP approval was by Kiran(?). BESCOM contractor (for permanent connection) was nAgarjuna / manju (smooth talking scamster). BWSSB contractor was Govindarajulu (via nAgArjuna).

## Vision
### Microplastic pollution avoidence
#### Paint
Idea was to minimize emission of microplastics into the environment by use of synthetic paints (as is the unfortunate practice going against the grain of our revered ancestors who enjoyed the earth without poisoning it with long lasting pollutants).

Only partly successful - 

- contractor insisted on transparent clear coat for much of the exterior, 
- वासुकिः insisted on usual paint for his floor,
- there was no readily available non-synthetic alternative for painting wood and metal.
- Even supposedly all natural lime-based paint purchased from Manoj Doot of Vedic paints came in plastic cans.

#### Wood lamination
- Wood laminates are often synthetic polymers. Polishes and varnishes tend to be synthetic as well. We went with Birch Plywood imported from Russia, purchased from Khemka Plywood at good prices. Quite good.


## House construction Tips
- The more you involve yourself in the construction, the better the outcome. The contractors simply often let it go on autopilot (often without even adequate supervision since they do 8/10 projects simultaneously).
- If you have time, engage specific sub-contractors youself - one for masonry, one for carpentry, one for interiors, one for plumbing, one for wiring etc.. and deal with them directly. You'll feel like you wasted less money. You'll have more control (downside: mistakes due to inexperience).
  - You will face problems coordinating them all - but such problems you'll typically face anyway - particlarly in finishing stages. Even with a contractor, one typically faces frustrating delays.
- Enquire a couple of places for the best price - rather than let yourself be "taken for a ride".
- Workers often give good and bad advice (to avoid work, cut costs etc..). Have a good bullshit detector.
- To get a good "office-work" contractor - directly approach the officer in charge and ask for a recommendation. Or ask around in the area (at construction sites).
